# Dyssol
Dyssol is a tool for dynamic flowsheet simulation of complex production processes with advanced treatment of granular materials.

For more information, please check the [documentation](https://github.com/FlowsheetSimulation/Dyssol-open/tree/master/Documentation). 
To refer Dyssol please use contribution of [Skorych et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2020.100572).
For new versions and updates, please check [here](https://github.com/FlowsheetSimulation/Dyssol-open/releases/latest).

# Requirements 
Dyssol should install and work on all latest versions of Windows.
Requires Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 to run.

# Compilation
A fully functional version can be compiled and biult with Microsoft Visual Studio 2015. A command-line version can also be compiled on Linux.

Requirements on Windows:
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2015
- Qt 5.8 msvc2015 / Qt 5.8 msvc2015_64
- Qt Visual Studio Tools for Visual Studio 2015
- Git

Also, other versions of Microsoft Visual Studio can be used, but additional preparations are required:
- All statically linked external libraries must be precompiled using the selected version. Scripts in ./ExternalLibraries may be used for that. To use scripts, the following requirements apply: Visual Studio 14 2015, cmake, PowerShell 5.0.
- If required, files assiciated with the Models Creator tool should be updated. They to be found in ./DyssolInstallers/Data/VCProject

Requirements on Linux:
- cmake 3.11.2
- gcc-7, g++-7

Biuld on Linux:
- Move to ./DyssolLinux/
- Install required build tools or run ./install_compiler.sh
- Run ./install_hdf5.sh and ./install_sundials.sh to build all required third-party libraries
- Run ./copy_files.sh to gather source files
- Run ./make_dyssol to build Dyssol

# Installation
