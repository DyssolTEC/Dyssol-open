UI:
- Allowed installation for a single user on Windows.
- In command line mode, time is written in s.ms format.

Models:
- Added residual moisture of granules to the Granulator model.
- Models from old DLL/SO files cannot be loaded in the current version (!).
- Some units were renamed: HeatExchanger -> Heat exchanger, InletFlow -> Inlet flow, OutletFlow -> Outlet flow, Screen Multi-deck -> Screen multi-deck. Old CLI scripts might be updated (!).

Models API:
- Added function CBaseUnit::AddNLVariables() to KINSOL solver to add multiple state variables.
- Added function CBaseUnit::ConfigureUnitStructures() to setup all the internal settings of the units from an existing one.
- Added another version of function CBaseUnit::GetTimePoints() to get the time points from the list of holdups and streams.
- Allowed to use CCheckBoxUnitParameter as grouping parameter (see CBaseUnit::AddParametersToGroup()).
- Added functions CBaseStream::GetAllOverallProperties()/CBaseUnit::GetAllOverallProperties() to obtain the list of all defined overall properties.
- Added function CStream::GetAccumulatedMass() to calculate the accumulated mass in the stream.
- Changed the algorithm for calculation of HEAT_CAPACITY_CP in CBaseStream::GetPhaseProperty().
- Added function CBaseStream::GetAllPhases() to obtain all defined phases.
- Added function CBaseStream::GetCompoundsNumber() to obtain the number of defined compounds.
- Added function CBaseStream::GetPhasesNumber() to get the number of defined phases.
- Added function CBaseStream::GetDistributionsNumber() to get the number of defined distributed parameters.
- Added function CNLSolver::GetSolverMaxIter() to set max iterations to NL solver.
- Added functions CPortsManager::GetInputPortsNames()/GetOutputPortsNames() to access port names.
- Added functions DiameterToMass() to calculate masses from particle diameters. 
- Added function AddVector() to add a value to all entries of the vector.
- Added functions Slice() and SetSlice() to simplify extraction and setting of _vars,  _ders, and _res in the solvers.
- Added functions GetDistributionMean(), GetDistributionVariance(), GetDistributionStdDev().
- Added functions to obtain limits of CDependentUnitParameter.
- Added function == to compare CChemicalReaction.
- Added function VectorContains() to check whether the vector contains a specified element.

Core:
- Drop support for Win32/x86 version.

Materials database:
- Add lactose to the default materials database.
- Added TP-dependent mass diffusion coefficient.
- Set the mass diffusion coefficient for H2O_gas in the default materials database.
- Added another power function as the correlation type.
- Added Ideal Gas function as the correlation type.
- Updated the density of Air in the default materials database to use the Ideal Gas correlation.

Fixes:
- Fixed a possible crash when saving a file in a write-protected directory.
- In some cases simulation wasn't stop after pressing the stop button.
- Fixed the work of Save Time Step setting in some cases.
- Fixed calculation of density for a mixture of compounds with the function CBaseStream::GetPhaseProperty.
- Fixed potential crash at program start.
- Defining unit parameters with the same name does not result in crash.
- Fixed possible crash when using internal streams from Initialize().
- Holdups and feeds will always have at least one time point upon creation.
- Fixed a rare bug if the Run button is double-clicked.

Other:
- Update default SUNDIALS library to v7.2.1.
- Other minor bug fixes and performance improvements.
