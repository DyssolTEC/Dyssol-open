UI:

Models:
- Added residual moisture of granules in the Granulator model.

Models API:
- Added functions DiameterToMass() to calculate masses from particle diameters. 
- Added function AddVector() to add the value to all values of the vector.
- Added function CBaseUnit::ConfigureUnitStructures() to setup all the internal settings of the units from an existing one.
- Added function AddNLVariables() to KINSOL solver to add multiple state variables.
- Added function Slice() and SetSlice() to simplify work with indexed arrays of values.
- Added functions GetDistributionMean(), GetDistributionVariance(), GetDistributionStdDev().
- Added functions to obtain limits of CDependentUnitParameter.

Core:
- Drop support of Win32/x86 version.

Materials database:
- Added TP-dependent mass diffusion coefficient.
- Added new correlation type.

Fixes:
- Fixed a possible crash when saving a file in a write-protected directory.
- In some cases simulation wasn't stop after pressing the stop button.
- Fixed the work of Save Time Step setting in some cases.
- Fixed calculation of density for a mixture of compounds with the function CBaseStream::GetPhaseProperty.
- Fixed potential crash at program start.
- Defining unit parameters with the same name do not result in crash.

Other:
- Allow installation for single user.
- Add lactose to the default materials database.
- Other minor bug fixes and performance improvements.
