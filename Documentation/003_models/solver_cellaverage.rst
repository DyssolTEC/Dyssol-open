Cell average
------------

This solver calculates the birth rate :math:`B_{agg}(n,v,t)` and death rate :math:`D_{agg}(n,v,t)` using a cell average technique. 


.. note:: solid phase and particle size distribution are required for the simulation. Equidistant volume grid for particle size distribution must be used.
